# #>
# #> From July 20, 1969, to July 20, 2023, is exactly 54 years. If today's date is after July 20, 2023, you

# #> To calculate the time elapsed from that moment until the current time (September 18, 2024, 17:47:19

# #>
# #> 1. From July 20, 1969, 20:17 UTC to July 20, 2024, 20:17 UTC is exactly 55 years.
# #> 2. From July 20, 2024, 20:17 UTC to September 18, 2024, 17:47:19 UTC, we need to further break down:
# #>
# #>    - From July 20, 2024, 20:17 UTC to September 18, 2024, 17:47:19 UTC, which is:
# #>      - 1 full month (August)
# #>      - 30 â€“ 20 = 10 days of July
# #>      - 18 days of September until 17:47:19 UTC
# #>
# #> So, in detail:
# #>    - 55 years
# #>    - 1 month
# #>    - 28 days
# #>    - From July 20, 2024, 20:17 UTC to July 20, 2024, 17:47:19 UTC: 23 hours, 30 minutes, and 19 seconds
# #>
# #> Time Total:
# #> - 55 years
# #> - 1 month
# #> - 28 days
# #> - 23 hours
# #> - 30 minutes
# #> - 19 seconds
# #>
# #> This is the exact time that has elapsed since Neil Armstrong's historic touchdown on the moon.
